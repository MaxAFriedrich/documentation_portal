# Documentation Portal

A modern portal for legal and administrative documentation.

Managed via git. Built on Hugo and Typst.

**Note**: This portal should not be used for sensitive documentation. **NO** authentication is provided.


## Usage

On [GitHub](https://github.com/moddedTechnic/documentation_portal), click the green "Use this template" button to create a new repository based on this one.

Clone your new repository to your local machine.

Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

Add your documentation to the `docs` directory.

Build with `python3 build.py`.

This will build a static site in the `public` directory, which you can serve with any static site server or deploy to a service like Cloudflare Pages.
